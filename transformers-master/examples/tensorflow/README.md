# Examples

This folder contains actively maintained examples of use of ðŸ¤— Transformers using the TensorFlow backend, organized along NLP tasks. It is under construction so we thank you for your patience!

Files containing `tf` such as `run_tf_glue.py` are the old-style files that will be rewritten very soon! Files without this such as `run_text_classification.py` are the newer ones. This message will be removed when the revamp is complete.

## The Big Table of Tasks

Here is the list of all our examples:
- with information on whether they are **built on top of `Keras`** (if not, they still work, they might
  just lack some features),
- whether or not they leverage the [ðŸ¤— Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) library.
- links to **Colab notebooks** to walk through the scripts and run them easily,
<!--
Coming soon!
- links to **Cloud deployments** to be able to deploy large-scale trainings in the Cloud with little to no setup.
